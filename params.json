User can submit his data using web framework and select different options according to his statistical analysis requirement.\r\n\r\nThe frontend is made through bootstrap framework and the backend in R using openCPU API.\r\nThe OpenCPU API defines a mapping between HTTP requests and R function calls which results in a natural RPC protocol. Different types of R statistical packages are used for different types of\r\nanalysis. The backend has different methods like data upload, data\r\nsummary, statistical test and fetch result.\r\n\r\n## Install hack\r\nFollow these instructions to install smartR for single user.\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(\"opencpu\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"smart_r\",\"namangt68\")\r\nlibrary(opencpu)\r\ninstall_github(\"smart_r\",\"namangt68\")\r\nopencpu$browse(\"library/smartR/www\")\r\n```\r\n## AIM\r\nDesign and implement a statistical analysis DIY(Do it yourself) tool that can\r\nbe used for primitive statistical analysis for business intelligence etc. Tool\r\nshould enable users to do different types of statistical tests on an easy to\r\nuse web based platform. \r\n\r\n## Project Plan\r\n1. Know about scope of project and its usefulness to overall business analyst community.\r\n\r\n2. Understanding different statistical tests and possible technologies that can be used.\r\n3. Design a project outlay map for execution, compare and decide among different available technologies that can be used to build that product.\r\n4. Setting the work architecture of the project and then its implementation.\r\n\r\n## Technology stack\r\n\r\n* OpenCPU API( for seamless integration of R and JavaScript)\r\n* Rstudio(for package management)\r\n* R statistical packages(for multivariate analysis etc.)\r\n* Bootstrap(framework for web UI)\r\n\r\n## Example analysis\r\nMany different types of analysis are implemented in smart-r. On selecting\r\ndifferent types of analysis different options for argument selection should\r\nbe shown (may depend on data uploaded for some analysis). Options for\r\ndifferent analysis types are:\r\n\r\nOne-Sample t test\r\n* test variable(s) selection\r\n* test value # testing if mean of x could be\r\n\r\nSample Result Display\r\n\r\n```\r\nOne Sample t-test\r\ndata:\r\nx\r\nt = -0.8547, df = 49, p-value = 0.3969\r\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 10\r\n95 percent confidence interval:\r\n9.797195 10.081767\r\nsample estimates:\r\nmean of x\r\n9.939481\r\n```\r\n\r\n## WorkFlow\r\nOnce the user upload his data file using on upload file button a R function\r\nuploaddata is called through OpenCPU api.\r\n\r\nThe user can select different arguments about data file type and type of\r\nanalysis he/she wants to do. The upload data function then again calls for\r\nread and validate data package and then data gets stored on server for\r\nfurther interpretation.\r\n\r\nAs per user input respective stastical fucntion is called and data get\r\nintrepreted.Once the statistical tests gets completed, data summary along\r\nwith the results are shown on web UI as per user input.\r\n\r\n## Future scope\r\nThis tool can later be developed into a full fledged business intelligence tool\r\nthat can create and distribute interactive dashboards which depict the\r\ntrends, variations and density of the data in different forms like graphs etc.\r\nIt may allow to connect to big data sources to acquire and process data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[GPL 3.0](LICENSE)\r\n",
